# About the project

I decided to create a combination of the two tests in just one application since I have experience in backend and frontend.

### The frontend

- Angular v7
- Bootstrap v4
- Sass

Hosted in github pages, [this is the link!](https://sanserna.github.io/rule-of-thumb/).

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.6.

## Frontend Development server

Run `yarn dev` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Frontend Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

### The Backend

- NodeJs
- ExpressJs v4
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- Babel v7

Server: [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), DB Server: [mLab](https://mlab.com/)

## Backend Development server

Run `yarn dev-api` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Backend Build

Run `build-api` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `api_dist/` directory.
